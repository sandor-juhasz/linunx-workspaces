# Manages isolated workspaces in Ubuntu.
#
# A workspace is an isolated working area which has its own Linux user account
# and can be configured with various initialization settings.
#
# The workspace can be created using the following command as root:
# `linux-workspaces create <name>`
# The command will create a Linux user called `workspace-<name>` with the 
# default password `welcome`.
#
# After the fist login the workspace initialization
# procedure will start in a terminal window. Later it can be started with the
# `linux-workspaces init` command and it will re-run the initialization for the
# current account.
#
# Workspaces can be deleted with the command `linux-workspaces delete <name>`
# as root. This command will remove the user and deletes the home directory as
# well. Please be careful when using this command.
