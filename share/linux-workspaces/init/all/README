This folder contains all the initialization scripts that need to be executed
for all workspaces.

The initialization scripts are standard Linux shell scripts. They should 
follow the naming convention of "##_scriptname.sh" where the ## is a 
number with leading zero if applicable. The initialization scripts are
executed in ascending order. If a script fails, the execution of subsequent
script is suspended.
